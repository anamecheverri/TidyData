Tidy Data Project - Data Science (Getting and Cleaning Data)
This repo contains 2 files:
1- run_analysis.R is a script that will read data in the current working directory (All data is in a directory called 
UCI HAR Dataset),and then:

. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2- CodeBook.md contains details on the variables and the transformations performed.
